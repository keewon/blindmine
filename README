Blindmine requires working installations of Python and Pygame,
which are available from <http://www.python.org/> and
<http://www.pygame.org/> respectively.  However, I can only test it on my
Windows XP and MacOSX Panther, where I use Python 2.3.4 and Pygame 1.5.

How to run:
for windows executable: just use run.bat
for people who has downloaded source code: pythonw blindmine.py
